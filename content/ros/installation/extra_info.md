## What is ``` .bashrc ``` file?

The bashrc file is a hidden file (that's why it starts with a '.') in the home directory. This file is a bash script (bash commands are what you write in the terminal). This script is executed by the system everytime a user opens a shell (terminal). So even if you use ssh, the file will also be executed.
